### 1. Install Graphcool CLI

You first have to install the [Graphcool CLI](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/cli/overview-kie1quohli/):

```sh
npm install -g graphcool
```

### 2. Deploy the GraphQL server

Navigate into the `server` directory and deploy the server:

```sh
cd server
graphcool deploy
```

When prompted, choose any of the **Shared Clusters**, e.g. `eu-west-1`.

yarn install
yarn start
```

Go to **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to start chatting ðŸ’¬
